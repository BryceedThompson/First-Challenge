# <First-Challenge>

## Description

This is my first challenge in the UCSD web dev course. The purpose of this site is to apply what I have learned in this course so far. This site is a basic
example of a website I might make for a company in the future. In this case it is for the fixional company Horiseon. The main issues that I fixed from the base
template are as follows:
- Added semantic HTML elemnets
- Created a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- Added accessible alt attributes to the icon and image elements

- Made sure heading attributes fall in sequential order
- Added a concise and descriptive title to the title element
